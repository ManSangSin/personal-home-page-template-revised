        <h2 id="section-about">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello world, thank you for visiting my page. From a young age, I have always enjoyed playing about with technology. I have a vivid memory of my older brother unboxing his very own computer (Packard Bell) and how advanced it was with its huuuge 20GB IDE hard drive running Windows Millenium. I recall the CRT monitor which came bundled with the computer, the screensize was sooo small compared to how big and boxy the actual monitor was (unlike our current "flatscreens" 😂) but it was still pretty amazing to the young me at the time. Many <span class="bold">many</span> hours was wasted playing solitaire and 3D pinball whilst listening to Winamp and watching its cool visualisations. Move along ~ decade, I watched in awe as my brother built his first custom PC and a few more years after that was when I was lucky enough to build my very own first PC. Even now, I am still using it and periodically upgrading parts (to be honest, other than the case, every other component has been swapped out lol.)</p>
        <p>Now, with my many years of experience messing about with different computers (touching on linux, raspbian, android, windows etc) and watching a lot of random tutorials online has made me the designated "tech guy" of the household. Any technical issues? No problem! Need advice purchasing tech? Ask away! I may not know the correct answer but I will try and help the best I can with what I know 😊.</p>
        <p>So, lets see... before my journey into coding, I studied Structural & Architectural Engineering in Strathclyde University. I learned a lot from my course, I enjoyed the calulations aspect, it made me more curious as a person of how things work and it help develop a lot of my core skills including presenting, teamworking, problem solving, time management and much much more but ultimately I did not felt it was right path for me.</p>
        <p>Currently I am working on an online course which is taught by google over on
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/configuration-management-cloud">Coursera</a> about Google IT Automation with Python. I have learned a lot of different concepts including "Python", Git" and IT automation using "Puppet". I have thoroughly enjoyed the course so far and would like to continue doing something similar which is why I decided to apply to CYF!
